# Assignment 6 messy code
# Change this to "tidy" format using dplyr verbs

# There's an intuitive dplyr version for everything you see here.

# Note: Do not erase the original code, just comment it out and put your own equivalent code below each section
# i.e., change each line of indicated code to a tidy version that does the same thing.

# Browse through those plots and answer the following questions:
# 1.  Which religious group correlates most strongly in a given area with the proportion of non-religious people?

#LDS, it has an Rsq.Val of 0.7565

# 2.  What is the direction of that correlation?

#downward. As LDS increases, non-religious decreases

# 3.  Which religious group has the second stronglest correlation, as above?

#Episcopal church, RSq.Val of 0.3557

# 4.  What is the direction of THAT correlation?

#upward. As Episcopal church increases,non-religious increases

# 5.  What can you say about these relationships?

#correlation â‰  causation
